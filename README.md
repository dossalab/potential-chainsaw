# This is potential-chainsaw, the universal remote control system (wip)

it runs on NRF5 and designed to be as universal as possible

it allows you to control any remote device, model or toy you have, efficiently

Some design notes:

- Supports Bluetooth Low Energy and potentially other transmission mediums;
- Variety of supported chips such as IMU, battery gauges;
- On-the-go reconfiguration of channels, mixing, stabilization alghorithms and more!
